      <h1>Programming on Solana when you’ve just installed Linux and don’t know what an npm is…</h1>
      <p>This tutorial assumes a debian-based linux system (Ubuntu, etc.) </p>
      <p>If you’re completely new, check out Pop_OS. It’s very user friendly and comes with a lot of useful stuff already installed.</p>
      <p>Once you’ve got your OS installed and booted up, the first place to go is the terminal.</p>
      <p>Check out this <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/command_line/read/command_line_interface">tutorial</a> to understand the terminal better </p>
      <p>
        The next thing we’ll need is an editor for our code. 
        Visual Studio code is a good option and we’ll install that now. 
        Later on I would recommend checking out Vim, which is a terminal-based editor. 
        (typing “vim” in the terminal will give install options. 
        After it installs, type “vimtutor” to learn more.)
      </p>
      <p>To install VS Code, download the .deb file from their website.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once downloaded, type “sudo apt install &lt;path to your file&gt;”</li>
        <li>The command for mine which was in the Downloads folder, looked like “sudo apt install ./Downloads/code_1.61.2-1634656828_amd64.deb”</li>
        <li>“./” represents the directory you are currently in. </li>
        <li>If I “cd” into Downloads first my command would be “sudo apt install ./code_1.61.2-1634656828_amd64.deb”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next is learning git and setting up a Github account.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start here with this <a href="http://jlord.us/git-it/">tutorial</a> for an overview of git and Github.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now that we’re setup on Github it is time to fire up some code!</p>
      <p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld">solana-labs/example-helloworld</a> repository</p>
      <p>Fork and clone the repo. Follow the steps <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">here</a></p>
      <p>Now that we have a local copy, start looking at the README.md. The first step is installing dependencies, the software needed to run our code.</p>
      <p>Installing node is first</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will use “node version manager” or “nvm”.</li>
        <li>Go <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">here</a>, scroll down and check out the readme.</li>
        <li>Under “Install & Update” run one of the two scripts (try curl first).If it says “command not found” use the command it suggests to install curl.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to “Verify Installation” and do that. If it outputs “nvm” you’re good. Otherwise try closing and reopening the terminal window like it says.</li>
        <li>To install node type “nvm install 14”. This will install node 14.18.1, as well as “node package manager” or “npm”.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check your versions with “node -v” and “npm -v” commands in the terminal.</p>
      <p>Next is installing Rust. This is pretty straightforward. Follow the excellent getting started page <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, install the <a href="https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools">solana command line tool suite</a>. 
        Follow the instructions under the “MacOS and Linux” heading.
        Once typing “solana --version” is working you’re ready to go!
      </p>
      <p>I'll leave it here for now. This is everything you need to get going on the first line of "solana-labs/example-helloworld" readme</p>
      <p>More stuff to explain later...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain clusters and localhost</li>
        <li>Explain the keygen command -> which file path does it end up in. What is being created (byte array)</li>
        <li>Npm install, what does it do?</li>
        <li>Npm run build:program-rust</li>
      </ul>
